Description: This is an Ashita v4 addon for Retail FFXI. It toggles the responses from Title NPCs to show missing or obtained Titles.

Installation: Put titleinverter.lua in your Ashita\addons\titleinverter folder. Load the addon by typing "/addon load Titleinverter".

Usage: /titleinverter (on|off)    -- Default is on

Note: Because the default behavior is on, you can simply load the addon and talk to any of the in-game title NPCs. Each response will show the Titles which your character does not currently have. To turn off the addon, type "/titleinverter" again or "/titleinverter off".
